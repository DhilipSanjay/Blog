# Travel

## Why I travel?

I love travelling. Travel helps me:
- To get away from a mundane routine.
- To get out of my comfort zone.
- To experience different cultures and cuisines.
- To make memories with interesting people!
- To be modest & humble by making me realize how big the world is & how tiny place I occupy in this world!
- To get a fresh new perspective about everything!

## Itinerary Lover

{% hint style="info" %}
Yes, I'm an **itinerary lover**!
{% endhint %}

I like **planned trips**. Unplanned or spontaneous travel is not my cup of tea. I plan the itinerary, do my research, decide on the places to visit, book the stay, look out for the must try food items from local restaurants - all these well ahead of the travel (weeks or months ahead).


> Sometimes I ask myself - _'I travel because I'm lost?! ... or ... I travel so that I can be found?!'_ I think may be it's both!

## Journeys across the years

Here I am documenting (may be include a few pics) my travel journeys & itinerary across the years, just so that I can look back & wonder - _'did I really travel to all these places?!'_

**Travel** is the best way to be lost and found at the same time!
